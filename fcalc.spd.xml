  <description>This component allows users to perform calculations on one or two input streams simultaneously on an element by element basis.
       Set the equation property for the function you wish to calculate with the variable &quot;a&quot; as the first input and &quot;b&quot; as the second input.

       For example &quot;3*a+4*b&quot; is a valid equation using both a and b
       for input a = [0,1,2,3,4] and b = [4,3,2,1,0] the output from the component would be
       out = [3*0+4*4, 3*1+4*3, 3*2+4*2, 3*3+4*1, 3*4+4*0] = [16,15,14,13,12]

       You can also use just a or b as follows:
       &quot;3*a&quot; or &quot;.2*b&quot;

       What operations are supported?  I'm glad you asked...
       The &quot;import&quot; property is a sequence of strings that are imported for you to use in your equation
       The default set-up include both math and random
       Both &quot;import x&quot; and &quot;from x import *&quot; are supported by default.
       This allows you to use functions like &quot;math.sin(3*a)+cos(4*b)+random.random()&quot;
       If you want to use your own custom methods just write your own custom python module, add it to the imports and you are off and running

       Finally - a word to the wise...with great power comes great responsibility

       The calculator offers lots of flexibility by allowing users to define their own functions in their custom modules
       This allows users to easily shoot themselves in the foot by doing weird (potentially harmful) things in their methods
       Use common sense when creating your own methods and configuring the equation to use this component responsibly.</description>
